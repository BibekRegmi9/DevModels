    <h3>Kathmandu</h3>

    <p>
      My name is Christina, a professional model based in Kathmandu City. After
      competing in beauty contests throughout my teens, I decided to pursue
      modeling as a full-time career. I signed with a small agency in 2016, and
      since then, my star has rapidly risen. I’ve been spotted in head-turning
      campaigns around the world, and my face has graced the runways of some of
      the biggest names in the industry. Aside from modeling, I’m also
      passionate about animal rights and volunteer at animal shelters whenever I
      get the chance.
